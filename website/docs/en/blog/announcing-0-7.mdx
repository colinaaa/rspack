# Announcing Rspack v0.7

> May 21, 2024

Rspack v0.7 supports lazy compilation. At the same time, Rspack configuration and external API tend to be stable, and more plugins compatibility has been verified.

## Major Feature Updates

### Lazy Compilation Support

Rspack 0.7.0 supports Lazy Compilation feature, which is very helpful for improving the build performance of multi-entry projects or large projects.

TODO: Performance comparison data

Now, you can enable the lazy compilation feature in Rspack through the [experiments.lazyCompilation](/config/experiments#experimentslazycompilation) configuration option:

```file=rspack.config.js
module.exports = {
  experiments: {
    lazyCompilation: true,
  },
};
```

### Tree Shaking Functionality Stability

The new tree shaking was introduced in Rspack 0.4.2 and enabled by default in version 0.6.0. After several months of bug fixes and optimizations, it has now reached a stable status.

Rspack 0.7.0 has removed the `builtins.treeShaking` (oldTreeShaking) configuration and the switch for toggling between the new and old tree shaking features, completely phasing out the old tree shaking functionality.

### More Plugins Compatibility Verified

In 0.7.0, we reviewed the compatibility status and alternative solutions for some common community plugins, such as `@vanilla-extract/webpack-plugin` and `moment-locales-webpack-plugin`, which are now compatible. There are alternatives for plugins like `workbox-webpack-plugin` and `webpack-manifest-plugin`.

For more details, see the [Plugin Compatibility List](/guide/compatibility/plugin).

Additionally, [Plugin API Support](/api/plugin-api/index) and plugin compatibility are ongoing efforts. If you encounter any plugins that are not compatible with Rspack, you are welcome to communicate with us through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues), and we will promptly support or provide alternatives.

## Breaking Changes

Rspack will gradually remove all unstable APIs and configurations before version 1.0, and more configurations / APIs / default behaviors will be align with webpack.

### Deprecating unstable JavaScript APIs

Rspack early exposed some APIs that were intended for internal use only and were unstable, such as `compiler.compilation` and `compiler.builtinPlugins`. These APIs were not stable and could not be used in webpack.

In 0.7.0, we reorganized the currently exposed APIs and their interface definitions. If you have been using these APIs, you will need to make the necessary adjustments to align with the implementations consistent with webpack.

### Remove builtins and experiments.rspackFuture.newTreeshaking

The new version of tree shaking was introduced in Rspack 0.4.2 and enabled by default in 0.6.0, after several months of bug fixes and optimizations, it has now reached a stable state.

In version 0.7.0, the `builtins` configuration which contains the feature of old tree shaking, has been removed, completely phasing out the old tree shaking as well as the switch for the new tree shaking feature.

### Remove resolve.browserField

This configuration is shorthand for `resolve.aliasFields = ["browser"]`, and since Rspack already supports `resolve.aliasFields`, this configuration is no longer necessary.

### Remove experiments.newSplitChunks

This configuration is used to enable the new splitChunks implementation, and since Rspack already uses the new splitChunks implementation by default, this configuration is no longer needed.

### Remove snapshot

This configuration is used to control the snapshot strategy when using cache. Under Rspack's current incremental rebuild architecture, cache no longer relies on snapshot, so this configuration is no longer needed.

### Remove exportsConvention for module type css

This configuration is used to control the naming convention of CSS module exports in experiments.css. It only has an effect on modules with the module type `css/module`, which have exports. For modules with the module type `css`, there are no exports, so this configuration is not needed.

### Upgrade SWC to 0.91.x

Upgraded the Rust crate `swc_core` to `0.91.x`. This will affect users of the SWC Wasm plugin.

## Migration Guide

### Upgrade the SWC plugins

In version `0.7.0`, the Rust crate `swc_core` has been upgraded to `0.91.x`. Users of the swc wasm plugin need to ensure version consistency with `swc_core` being used, otherwise, it may lead to unforeseen issues.

For more details, please see this [document](https://swc.rs/docs/plugin/selecting-swc-core#091x) of swcã€‚

### Replace resolve.browserField with resolve.aliasFields

If you previously configured `resolve.browserField`, you will need to replace it with `resolve.aliasFields`:

- `resolve.browserField = true` is replaced with `resolve.aliasFields = ["browser"]`
- `resolve.browserField = false` is replaced with `resolve.aliasFields = []`

### Remove generator.css.exportsConvention

If you previously configured `module.generator.css.exportsConvention` or `generator.exportsConvention` in `module.rule`, you only need to delete that configuration.
